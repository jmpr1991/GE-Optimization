# GE-Optimization
Computation of an indefinite integral using Grammatical Evolution (GE)

This project implements a GE algorithm to compute indefinite integrals.

It is submitted as part of the coursework for the Evolutionary Computation subject in the Masterâ€™s program in Artificial Intelligence Research at UNED.

The primary objective of this task is to gain a deeper understanding of how EG works, the various steps involved, and how hyperparameters (e.g., mutation parameters) influence both in the convergence and the quality of the solution.

The file constants.py allows users to modify the hyperparameter values and adjust the distribution of cities within the search area.

Additionally, the EG can be easily adapted to find the integral of another function.

Note: decoder.py, has been taken using the decoder function implemented in PONYGE algorithm https://github.com/jmmcd/ponyge/tree/master
